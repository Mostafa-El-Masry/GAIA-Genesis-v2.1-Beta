# What’s New · v2.1 — Week 1 (Unify Learning)

- Created **Apollo** with three tabs: **Archives**, **Tower**, **Academy**.
- Built **Tower Home** with starter subject cards (HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind).
- Added **TabNav** component and basic routes under `/apollo`.
- Prep work for Week 2 (inline practice editor + live preview).
