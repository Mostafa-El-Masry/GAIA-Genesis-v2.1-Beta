# What's New @ v2.1 — Week 2 (Practice-in-Place)

- Landed the Abollo Topic workspace at `/apollo/tower/topics/[slug]` with Lesson → Practice → Preview layout.
- Added Monaco-powered editors (with textarea fallback), auto-save + Saved indicator, and live preview iframe with sandbox guardrails.
- Local practice store now tracks snippets, XP, percent, and last touched per topic (capped at 100 XP).
- Lesson pane can queue multiple code blocks and send them directly into the practice editor.
- Persistence + XP logic lives locally for now (Week 2 scope); preview success + completion award minimal XP.

## Paths
- `app/apollo/(tabs)/tower/topics/[slug]/page.tsx`
- `app/apollo/(tabs)/tower/topics/[slug]/TopicShell.tsx`
- `app/apollo/(tabs)/tower/topics/[slug]/components/LessonPane.tsx`
- `app/apollo/(tabs)/tower/topics/[slug]/components/PracticePane.tsx`
- `app/apollo/(tabs)/tower/topics/[slug]/components/PreviewPane.tsx`
- `app/apollo/(tabs)/tower/lib/practiceStore.ts`
- `app/apollo/(tabs)/tower/lib/xp.ts`
- `app/apollo/(tabs)/tower/lib/composeDocument.ts`

## Notes
- Local storage key: `practice_snippets` with versioned payload + snippet award flags.
- XP heuristic: +1 (first save), +1 (preview success), +2 (complete panes) capped at 100 per topic.
- Preview sandbox strips `javascript:` URLs, silences `window.top`, and reports errors back to the UI.
